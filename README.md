# AI Trends in Education 
This project leverages clustering techniques to group undergraduate students based on their characteristics and preferences for personalized AI learning resource recommendations. To better understand the dataset, visualizations were created to explore key patterns, including the distribution of AI knowledge scores, preferred learning sources, and perceived usefulness of AI in education. These insights informed the clustering process, enabling the recommendation of tailored resources like courses, books, and interactive tools to enhance students' understanding of artificial intelligence.
